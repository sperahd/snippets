## 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline

### Given Problem
In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings). Height 0 is considered to be a building as well. 

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid.

### Actual Problem

Let row_max[i] be the max values in each row of the grid
Let col_max[j] be the max values in each col of the grid

For any given grid increase values in grid[i][j] such that in the resulting the values of row_max[i] and col_max[i] does not change

### Solution

For each item grid[i][j] take min(row_max[i], col_max[j]) as the new value of grid[i][j]
