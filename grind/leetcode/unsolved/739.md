## 739. Daily Temperatures

### Given Problem

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.

For example, given the list of temperatures T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73], your output should be [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

### Actual Problem
Given an array return an array consisting of indices where the next higher item for each index occurs.

### Solution

1. Brute Force - Two loops
2. Use a stack - Still thinking
