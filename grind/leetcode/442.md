## 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

### Given Problem

Given an array of integers, **1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array)**, some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

### Constraints
O(n) time and no space

### Solution

1. Brute force - Push items in set if it does not already exist, if it already exists then add it to the solution vector.
2. Puzzle logic - The concept here is to negate each number's index as the input is 1 <= a[i] <= n (n = size of array). Once a value is negated, if it requires to be negated again then it is a duplicate.
