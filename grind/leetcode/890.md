## 890. Find and replace pattern

### Given Problem
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 

You may return the answer in any order.

### Actual problem
Given a string S - "anoa" and T - "ktek" find out whether these two strings are following the same pattern i.e. one character from t maps to one and only one character in T

### Solution
Normalize the pattern string and then compare against normalized form of each string. Add strings into result if normalized pattern and normalized string are same. See:concepts.md#String%20Normalization
