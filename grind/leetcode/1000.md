## Merge piles 2 at a time to result in one single pile at the end with minimum sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-merge-stones/discuss/247657/JAVA-Bottom-Up-%2B-Top-Down-DP-With-Explaination

Actual Array is called array

Prefix Sum:

~~~~
int sum[n+1] = {0};
for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
{
    sum[i] = sum[i-1] + array[i]
}
~~~~
Recurrence:

~~~~
dp(i,j) = 

for all k {k >= i && k< j}
{
    min(dp[i][k]+dp[k+1][j]) + sum(itoj){which is sum[j] - sum[i-1]}
}
~~~~

For piles 1 to n(say 4)

The solution is:

~~~~

Fill dp(i,i) to 0 first merging a single pile to 1 does not require any cost

for (i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
{
    dp(i,i) = 0;
}

Fill single merge operation items at the beginning first
as there is 
for(i = 1; i <= 4; i++)
{
    dp(i,i+1) = array[i+1];
}

min {
        dp(1,1)           +         dp(2,4)
        {Only first Pile}       {cost of merging piles 2 to 4}
        dp(1,2)           +         dp(3,4)
        {Merging piles 1 to 2}  {Merging piles 3 to 4}
        dp(1,3)           +         dp(4,4)
        {Merging piles 1 to 3}  {Merging piles 3 to 4}
    } sum(1,4){Sum of all elements from 1 to 4}
