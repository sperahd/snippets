## 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array

### Given Problem
Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Example: [1,1,2,2,3] should return 3

### Constraints

O(logn) time and O(1) space

### Solution

Mid divides the sorted array into two parts(mid is exactly the middle as this array would have odd number elements) left and right.
#### Two cases:
1. mid = (end+begin)/2 is even then: if the item next to Array[mid] == Array[mid+1] answer is on right side and vice-versa.
2. mid = (end+begin)/2 is odd then: if the item next to Array[mid] == Array[mid+1] answer is on right side and vice-versa.

Why? Since Mid divides the array into equal parts containing even number of items, if mid's equality lies on one side, then that side remains with odd number of items and hence solution has to be there.
