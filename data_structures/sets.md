## Set

A set is an unordered collection of objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is
said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A.

## Examples:

The set O of odd positive integers less than 10 can be expressed by 
> O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
> O = {x ∈ Z + | x is odd and x < 10}. Z + is the Universe of positive integers.

## Equal sets

Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. Therefore, if A and B are sets, then A and B are equal if and only if ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B). We write A = B if A and B are equal sets.

## Subsets

The set A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. We use the notation A ⊆ B to indicate that A is a subset of the set B.
> every nonempty set S is guaranteed to have at least two subsets, the empty set and the set S itself, that is, ∅ ⊆ S and S ⊆ S

## Size of a set
Let S be a set. If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a finite set and that n is the cardinality of S. The cardinality of S is denoted by |S|.

## Cartesian product of set

Let A and B be sets. The Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Hence,
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ B}.

Example 1:

What is the Cartesian product of A = {1, 2} and B = {a, b, c}?

A × B = {(1, a), (1, b), (1, c), (2, a), (2, b), (2, c)}.

Example 2:

What do the statements ∀x∈ R (x 2 ≥ 0) and ∃x∈ Z (x 2 = 1) mean?

Solution: The statement ∀x∈ R(x 2 ≥ 0) states that for every real number x, x 2 ≥ 0. This statement can be expressed as “The square of every real number is nonnegative.” This is a true statement.

The statement ∃x∈ Z(x 2 = 1) states that there exists an integer x such that x 2 = 1. This statement can be expressed as “There is an integer whose square is 1.” This is also a true statement because x = 1 is such an integer (as is −1).

## Union of sets
Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set that contains those elements that are either in A or in B, or in both.
The union of the sets {1, 3, 5} and {1, 2, 3} is the set {1, 2, 3, 5}; that is, {1, 3, 5} ∪ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 5}.

## Intersection of sets

Let A and B be sets. The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set containing those elements in both A and B.
The intersection of the sets {1, 3, 5} and {1, 2, 3} is the set {1, 3}; that is, {1, 3, 5} ∩ {1, 2, 3} = {1, 3}

## Disjoint sets

Two sets are called disjoint if their intersection is the empty set.
Let A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}. Because A ∩ B = ∅, A and B are disjoint.

## Complement of a set
Let U be the universal set. The complement of the set A, denoted by A, is the complement of A with respect to U . Therefore, the complement of the set A is U − A.
